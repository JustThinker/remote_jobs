...and actually execute these ideas in code
We want to make B2B analytics as accessible as possible but also have a cool product to show off ;) You will work directly with the founders to make HockeyStack the coolest product on the market.
Non-technical Expectations
Excellent communication skills (English) is a must.
We aren‚Äôt looking for someone with 20 years of experience, we are looking for smart people who are up for a challenge.
You should have experience with at least a CRM, an analytics tool, or a MarTech tool of some kind.
you should have some context on this industry beforehand
This also means that your role within the company is bound to grow and gain importance over time.
Why HockeyStack?
The company is very young for where we want to be, but although this may scare some people off, we believe that this is a tremendous opportunity to actually build something greater than all of us. We have the fastest team in our market right now and we want to keep it that way. We are already becoming a market leader in the attribution space, but we need more teammates (aka you) for our more ambitious goals.

Collaboration is mostly through Slack and GitHub issues. We usually have 3 to 4 calls a week, though that's pretty flexible.

THE OPPORTUNITY
We‚Äôre looking for candidates with strong track records of putting mobile and desktop apps to work and bringing products to life. You should be experienced in Flutter and backend with a Postgres/Node stack.
We're a remote company so the bulk of our work is written ‚Äì from the code and interfaces we design, to the pull request discussions and requests for comments we make ‚Äì being a good writer is important. Effective, concise writing leads to effective, concise code.
We do good work together. That comes with direct feedback, openness to each others‚Äô experience, and willingness to show up for each other as well as for the technical work at hand. We‚Äôre in this for the long term.
While you'll report to a team lead, Sora Schools is a company where self managers thrive. We're quick to trust that you can do it, and here to support you in making it so. You can expect to be counted on. You can expect to do your best work and build a career here.
What you‚Äôll be working on
As a Flutter Engineer at Sora Schools, you'll work to build new product features and keep our app fast, secure, and reliable. But, depending on your interests and skills, you may do more feature work or more infrastructure work but the boundaries are fluid, and people can switch work scopes.
Right now, we're maintaining our LMS Sora Home 1.5 in web tech, and building its next mobile-first version Sora Home 2.0. Our web version is currently built as with a Node.js back-end React front-end, and going forward, we're all-in on Flutter mobile and desktop apps.
We use a variant of Shape Up methodology so you won't have a backlog of tickets to blindly check. Your work shall be deliberate. You'll receive entire projects to tackle end-to-end in 5 week cycles where you'll do your own discovery, both on the code and on the product, before you dive into writing your own code, Scope Hammering, testing, debugging, refactoring and shipping! But you'll not be alone. You'll have full support of QA and Sora seasoned engineers to help you along the way.
Here are some real examples of mobile work we‚Äôve done lately that might help you to get a better idea of what the job could entail:
Setup a new Flutter project with CI/CD setup and local cache, state management and routing libraries
Setting up a design system package and implementing our first components

company:Parity Technologies
description:Parity Technologies builds core infrastructure for blockchains and Web 3.0 technologies. This means dealing with P2P networking, consensus algorithms, cryptography, databases, and decentralised applications. We strive to write the fastest, lightest, and safest core technology in Blockchain and write lots of open-source code.
At Parity Technologies, we have built and launched live networks like Kusama and Polkadot atop the Substrate blockchain framework. We want to bring to these networks first-class end-to-end user experiences which tell a story of how easy it is to use these next-generation blockchains. For example, improving how users participate in network staking, how members of our governance systems present and vote on proposals, enabling simple integration of Substrate systems into web pages, improving how new users onboard into our ecosystem, and more‚Ä¶
In this role, you‚Äôll help bring to life an open-source TypeScript toolkit to enhance the Substrate / Web 3 developer experience. The aim of this toolkit is to reduce friction in creating efficient interactions with many chains. You will work in a small functional team with two front-end developers, one backend developer, and one designer to create core utilities, pattern libraries, and examples. This will be the basis for a new open source community, of which you‚Äôll be a steward. We will all share the responsibility of triaging issues, engaging with developers, and assessing their needs. This role will surely evolve, and hopefully, you‚Äôll help drive its evolution. There will be many ways to help the toolkit and its users succeed.
About You:
You have experience building both browser and NodeJS applications with TypeScript.
You think deeply about paradigm-shifting tools, such as React and GraphQL.
Well-designed APIs bring you immense joy.
You have excellent communication skills.
Writing legible, maintainable code is more important to you than are your stylistic preferences.
To you, release announcements from the TypeScript team feel like special occasions. Maybe you even follow along with notes from the TypeScript team‚Äôs design meetings.
You don‚Äôt need to be a blockchain expert. Just excited and willing to learn!
Responsibilities:
Collaborating with the team on design, roadmap and overall strategy
Writing both low-level and high-level code
Modeling chain interactions as type-safe, composable building blocks
Documenting your creations
Identifying bugs, bottlenecks and opportunities for improvement
Actively participating in / supporting a new community in open source
Good to have:
Language design, compiler, interpreters.
Creating and releasing open source
Effect-oriented programming (ZIO, effect-ts)
Knowledge of Web Assembly

description:About Venturerock
Venturerock is an early-stage digital venture capital platform and ecosystem of founders, backers & builders.
Together, we have transformed the venture capital model into a venture building model, to build & grow tech companies into global tech leaders. We have combined technology and our experience in accelerating 700+ startups to design our own investment protocol. Our founder team has been part of companies like Just-Eat, iChoosr, Exact, Relayr to mention a few. We invest in multiple rounds from pre-seed to scale, through a metered and auditable process.
Responsibilities for this Lead developer role for "Drop-ET":
You will use our blueprint to build, measure, learn and pivot your way to a¬†profitable and thriving company. This does not mean everything is set in stone because our founders will need to put their own stamp on everything they're doing. Later, you'll assemble a dedicated team and define a unique company culture.
Some technical founder activities include:
Design and build the technical blueprint of the company;
Building the (cloud) infrastructure;
Product development;
Managing every technical detail;
Build and hire a development team;
Scaling the operation.
Of course, there is more to do, but you don‚Äôt have to do it all by yourself. You'll be accompanied by a co-founder to take on this great challenge. Also, our FoundersLAB is available to support you during the first rough months.
Problem Statement:
Drop-ET¬†is a Smart Logistics Platform for the APAC countries. Due to enormous growth in e-commerce A-Brands have been hijacking all delivery capacity in India. Delivery companies are overbooked, and the rest of the non-A brand e-commerce companies don‚Äôt have access to reliable delivery.
With Drop-ET we help delivery companies and medium-sized e-commerce companies get in control again. We are developing a fully equipped delivery EV, attainable for everyone. No CAPEX, everyone can immediately start as a delivery agent and they only pay-per-use. This delivery EV is connected to our platform, this means better routes, extra orders and collecting POI data during your Drop-ET rides. This amazing adventure still has some essential seats left. Do you want to hop on board of our EV and join our journey to a smarter Indian transport
ecosystem?
You have 5+ experience as a full-stack developer (i.e. front-end and back-end);
Strong experience with modern JavaScript (ES2017), Node.js, HTML,

Enforce code quality through Test-Driven Development and linting.
