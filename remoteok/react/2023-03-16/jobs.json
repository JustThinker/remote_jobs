You should be experienced in Flutter and backend with a Postgres/Node stack.\nWe're a remote company so the bulk of our work is written \u2013 from the code and interfaces we design, to the pull request discussions and requests for comments we make \u2013 being a good writer is important. Effective, concise writing leads to effective, concise code.\nWe do good work together. That comes with direct feedback, openness to each others\u2019 experience, and willingness to show up for each other as well as for the technical work at hand. We\u2019re in this for the long term.\nWhile you'll report to a team lead, Sora Schools is a company where self managers thrive. We're quick to trust that you can do it, and here to support you in making it so. You can expect to be counted on. You can expect to do your best work and build a career here.\nWhat you\u2019ll be working on\nAs a Flutter Engineer at Sora Schools, you'll work to build new product features and keep our app fast, secure, and reliable. But, depending on your interests and skills, you may do more feature work or more infrastructure work but the boundaries are fluid, and people can switch work scopes.\nRight now, we're maintaining our LMS Sora Home 1.5 in web tech, and building its next mobile-first version Sora Home 2.0. Our web version is currently built as with a Node.js back-end React front-end, and going forward, we're all-in on Flutter mobile and desktop apps.\nWe use a variant of Shape Up methodology so you won't have a backlog of tickets to blindly check. Your work shall be deliberate. You'll receive entire projects to tackle end-to-end in 5 week cycles where you'll do your own discovery, both on the code and on the product, before you dive into writing your own code, Scope Hammering, testing, debugging, refactoring and shipping! But you'll not be alone. You'll have full support of QA and Sora seasoned engineers to help you along the way.\nHere are some real examples of mobile work we\u2019ve done lately that might help you to get a better idea of what the job could entail:\nSetup a new Flutter project with CI/CD setup and local cache, state management and routing libraries\nSetting up a design system package and implementing our first components\nCreate a mobile specific endpoint in our backend with Prisma and Node\nDevelop a simple calendar component that properly handles conflicting events\nCoding a mobile Google Authentication flow\nAll of those also were carefully tested with unit tests, integration tests and ultimately manual tests to ensure the UX is actually great!\nThis is a fully remote position. You\u2019re free to work where you work best: home office, co-working space, coffeeshops. We are primarily hiring from the Americas but as long as your workday can have at least a 4-hour overlap with an Atlanta workday (eastern time zone 9-5), it can work. We don't want anyone working a graveyard shift to make that happen, though.\nApply Now!\nC2C Candidates: This role is not available to C2C candidates working with an agency. If you are a professional contractor who has created an LLC/corp around their consulting practice, this is well aligned with Braintrust and we\u2019d welcome your application.\nBraintrust values the multitude of talents and perspectives that a diverse workforce brings.
