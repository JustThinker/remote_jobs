company:HockeyStack
description:HockeyStack
We launched the final iteration of the product last year. We are now scaling our product and building out new features.
Technical Expectations
As a backend-focused engineer, you will mostly be:
integrations with third-party data sources
Refactor parts of our backend code
It’s good to have some or all of:
SQL knowledge
AWS experience
Node.js
Express
The gist of this position is how good you are with reading through third-party APIs, handling and transforming large datasets with performance and scalability in mind, as well as the quality of the code you write.
Non-technical Expectations
Excellent communication skills (English) is a must.
We aren’t looking for someone with 20 years of experience, we are looking for smart people who are up for a challenge.
You should have experience with at least a CRM, an analytics tool, or a MarTech tool of some kind.
you should have some context on this industry beforehand
This also means that your role within the company is bound to grow and gain importance over time.
Why HockeyStack?
The company is very young for where we want to be, but although this may scare some people off, we believe that this is a tremendous opportunity to actually build something greater than us. We have the fastest team in our market right now and we want to keep it that way. We are already becoming a market leader in the attribution space, but we need more teammates (aka you) for our more ambitious goals.

company:Parity Technologies
description:We are seeking an innovative and accomplished Application Security Engineer to join the Parity Security team. You will take a critical role in upholding the security of Parity Technologies products, from conceptual in their design to completion.
You will influence the technical architecture of new products, ensuring that security is a keystone in their designs. You would be the owner of Application security of new and existing products through pentesting and threat modelling, and contributing towards internal tooling and integration to ensure that security is baked into the software development lifecycle. Engineers will come to you as a trusted source of guidance for the secure development and maintenance of their products. Your insight will be consulted for strategic technical decisions, to guarantee that security is not an afterthought in our technical roadmap.
Being part of the preventative defense for our company, you'll identify and mitigate emerging threats to Parity Technologies environment stemming from vulnerabilities and architectural issues in the earlier stages of our products. Educating engineers on secure development practices will come into play, through a combination of educational software and your guidance.
A day in the life:
Work with other application security engineers on technical development of project in JavaScript/TypeScript or Rust. Contributing to the main public open-source projects shaping the future of the ecosystem.
Provide technical expertise and guidance for developers around the secure development of their products. Keep up to date with evolving InfoSec trends, emerging risks, and growing industry-wide technological shifts.
Perform assessments of products, such as pentests, or services that are being tested but are not yet in production.
Sympathize with the goals trying to be achieved by other teams; help to push solutions out securely rather than just blocking solutions outright. We're here to work with others getting their products out in a manner that's secure for our customers, not to just reject solutions without context.
About you:
Experience working with JavaScript APIs and Node.js. We use TypeScript, but good if you don’t know it and want to learn it OR Rust programming, you’ve probably played with it in your spare time, if not at a previous job.
Ability to learn new technologies and concepts quickly.
Have exposure to cryptography, decentralized networking, hardware key management solutions. Basics at least, we want you to be motivated to learn more.
Know your security tools and approaches: you should be leading our way when setting up SAST, DAST, fuzzing, property-based testing, symbolic execution, network simulation tools and such.
Be a self-starter: most of the time there would be little guidance on which areas to work on first and what to improve there. You’re expected to determine that yourself, keeping company-wide goals in mind, and drive those initiatives to completion.
If possible, we'd also love you to have:
Have experience in threat modelling, red/blue teaming, working with best in class independent security teams and turning their findings into actual deployed fixes in our codebase;
Prior work experience in blockchain/cryptocurrency fields.
A background in open-source software development.
Passionate about Web 3.0 and what it represents for the future.
Anywhere in the world, we want you!
Flexible working and Remote? Yes, please!
About Parity
The team at Parity builds core infrastructure to power a better internet. We do this by innovating in and fostering the open-source ecosystem surrounding blockchain development, also known as Web 3.0.
Every day we interact with technologies controlled by a handful of large companies whose interests often conflict with our own. Despite that conflict, we still use their software either because many of the benefits seem to outweigh any perceived risk, we feel there is no choice, or there is no better alternative. As a result, we end up granting such companies access to our personal data which, in turn, gives them far-reaching control over our digital lives and in that, unprecedented influence over a multitude of globally impactful initiatives and innovations.
Parity Technologies is a team of the world’s premiere blockchain developers building industry-leading technologies that enable developers to create the next wave of better products and services that respect the freedom and data of individuals. You’ll join at a critical moment when the future of the decentralized web is being shaped, and perform an influential role in making a more equitable society for our future.
We primarily steward the Substrate ecosystem which includes Polkadot and Kusama, both of which are next-generation, sharded, multichain networks. Our flagship product, Substrate, is an open-source modular and extensible blockchain-building framework that allows rapid innovation and fast deployment of custom-built blockchains. Substrate provides the core building blocks of blockchains built for deployment to Polkadot and Kusama. Our key programming language is Rust, and all of our work is open source.

What Will You Do?
You will be part of Kleros’ software development team, working closely with the team on open source code. You will develop front ends that bring Kleros to life: write code, participate in code reviews, conduct tests and work with our designers to create clean interfaces.
At Kleros we develop many Decentralized Applications (DApps). You will work on core Kleros products like Court, as well as the many peripheral applications we build that interact with Kleros.

There are also opportunities to get involved with smart contract development and product development.
The Ethereum ecosystem is innovating quickly; so above all, you will be learning new things all the time.
Some of the responsibilities include:
Front-end development using Javascript, Typescript, React and EthersJS.
Build fully functional DApps that interact with the Ethereum blockchain and Kleros Court.
Take part in the design process and user testing.
Taking responsibility for improving and maintaining existing projects.
Requirements
At least 3 years of experience in EthersJS, React, Javascript and/or Typescript.
A previous blockchain experience is not necessarily required but candidates should be able to demonstrate a blockchain interest (read blog posts / scientific articles, tried dapps on mainnets or testnets).
You need to deeply understand the mission and product of Kleros.
Perks
Most of the compensation (2/3) is labelled in fiat and paid in crypto.
The remaining (1/3) is labelled in PNK vested over 3 years with a 1 year cliff ensuring you get a stake in the project.
We are a cooperative, so as a worker you own part of the company and get voting rights.
Want to Apply?
You can apply on this website with an application note answering the following questions:
1) Why do you think you are a good fit for this role?
2) Why would you like to work on Kleros?
3) What is the address of the KlerosLiquid smart contract on the mainnet that https://court.kleros.io uses and the value of its maxDrawingTime variable? Let’s test your sleuthing skills!
