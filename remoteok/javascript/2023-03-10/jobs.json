Protocol Labs is a product-development lab, but behind the protocols and tools we build, behind the research and implementations, are passionate people, teammates and community members. Most teams in the Protocol Labs Network are fully distributed and work remotely around the world. Engineers, researchers, and operators work in the open to improve the internet \u2014 humanity's most important technology \u2014 as we explore new advances at the intersection of many exciting fields (crypto, networks, distributed systems) and cultures (startups, research, open source, distributed work).\nEnthusiasm about the decentralized web and blockchains has brought an influx of people who want to use distributed systems but who don't know how to build the necessary infrastructure. We are building that infrastructure. To continue that work, we're looking for people who thoroughly understand the principles of distributed systems and cryptography, and who will lean into the challenges of applying those principles in open-source code that will be deployed worldwide.\nFilecoin\nFilecoin, a decentralized storage network to store humanity's most valuable information, is one of the most promising projects of Web3. In the two years since its launch, over 18 exabytes of storage have been pledged to the Filecoin network, which is proven and verified by node operators every single day. As we look forward, many challenges remain to be solved such as continuing to scale the network, allowing user programmability through the addition of a Virtual Machine, and implementing cutting-edge ideas coming from the latest in cryptographic research. \nFilecoin Saturn\nOne such challenge is the reliable, performant, and economic retrieval of content from Filecoin. Filecoin Saturn is a decentralized content delivery network (CDN) for Filecoin. We're seeking a tech lead engineer to join the Filecoin Saturn team.\nFor this role, we particularly value experience independently designing and implementing significant components of complex systems, and the execution focus and discipline to carry projects to completion.

        "description": "About Protocol Labs\nProtocol Labs drives breakthroughs in computing to push humanity forward. Protocol Labs is a product-development lab, but behind the protocols and tools we build, behind the research and implementations, are passionate people, teammates and community members. Most teams in the Protocol Labs Network are fully distributed and work remotely around the world. Engineers, researchers, and operators work in the open to improve the internet \u2014 humanity's most important technology \u2014 as we explore new advances at the intersection of many exciting fields (crypto, networks, distributed systems) and cultures (startups, research, open source, distributed work).\nEnthusiasm about the decentralized web and blockchains has brought an influx of people who want to use distributed systems but who don't know how to build the necessary infrastructure. We are building that infrastructure. To continue that work, we're looking for people who thoroughly understand the principles of distributed systems and cryptography, and who will lean into the challenges of applying those principles in open-source code that will be deployed worldwide.\nFilecoin\nFilecoin, a decentralized storage network to store humanity's most valuable information, is one of the most promising projects of Web3. In the two years since its launch, over 18 exabytes of storage have been pledged to the Filecoin network, which is proven and verified by node operators every single day. As we look forward, many challenges remain to be solved such as continuing to scale the network, allowing user programmability through the addition of a Virtual Machine, and implementing cutting-edge ideas coming from the latest in cryptographic research.\u00a0\nFilecoin Saturn\nOne such challenge is the reliable, performant, and economic retrieval of content from Filecoin.\u00a0Filecoin Saturn\u00a0is a decentralized content delivery network (CDN) for Filecoin. We're seeking a tech lead engineer to join the Filecoin Saturn team.\u00a0\nFor this role, we particularly value experience independently designing and implementing significant components of complex systems, and the execution focus and discipline to carry projects to completion. Experience leading strong open source communities and/or contributing to other blockchain-like projects will be very highly regarded, as well as experience working on low-latency engineering projects.\nAs Tech Lead for Filecoin Saturn at Protocol Labs, you will\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\nLead engineering and technical efforts for Filecoin Saturn, Filecoin\u2019s Content Delivery Network (CDN)\nBe responsible for Saturn\u2019s technical architecture and design\nLead other engineers \u2013 directly and set an example of engineering excellence\nDesign and implement performant and resilient distributed systems at scale\nRun, scale, and maintain production software used by millions around the world\nContribute to protocol design and specification efforts\nInterface with other technical teams both inside and outside of Protocol Labs\nSolve hard problems in low-trust distributed systems\nTake research and turn it into working, scalable programs and systems\nWork with a cross-functional team including engineering, design, community, product, and business\nEngage and educate the community, from users to contributors\nProvide guidance and review for open source contributions and contributors around the world (Filecoin Saturn is open source on Github!)\nYou may be a fit for this role if you have\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.\nBA/BS degree in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, related field or equivalent practical experience\nSignificant experience building applications using Javascript and Python, Go, or Rust\nA solid understanding of distributed systems principles and applications\nExperience designing and building distributed and/or peer-to-peer software systems and applications\nA strong technical design ability informed by broad experience across multiple domains/specialties\nLeadership experience building and maintaining large-scale, production software\nLiteracy with cryptographic principles and practices\nProven track record of independently driving projects in a fast-paced environment\nExcellent communication skills on both technical and non-technical issues\nA keen awareness of teamwork, process, and patterns of successful collaboration\nExcellent written and verbal communication skills\nBonus Points\nExperience leading open source projects, and/or guiding their communities\nSecurity engineering and/or cryptography principles and practices\nLarge-scale systems (especially networking, performance, storage, or reliability engineering)\nExperience building with decentralized building blocks such as DHTs, consensus protocols, smart contracts, blockchain, p2p networking, etc.\nExperience building a CDN\nWhat\u2019s it like to work at Protocol Labs?\nProtocol Labs' mission is to improve humanity\u2019s most important technology, the Internet. We build protocols, systems, and tools to improve how it works. Today, we are focused on how we store, locate, and move information. Our projects include IPFS, Filecoin, libp2p, and more.\n\u00a0\nAs a distributed team, we hire anywhere in the world, and at various levels of experience (entry, senior, staff). We look for people with unique perspectives and diverse backgrounds.\nThe base pay for this position currently ranges from $248,000 to $328,000, plus cryptocurrency, equity, and opportunities for upside through performance rewards in cryptocurrency and equity.\u00a0The base pay is based on a number of factors and may vary depending on job-related knowledge, experience, skills, abilities, training, and education.\u00a0We also have a great benefits package, including parental and other forms of leave, contributions to your retirement, and unlimited time off. For U.S.-based employees, we also provide competitive health, dental, and vision coverage for you and your family.\nLI-Remote\nEngineering at Protocol Labs\nWith IPFS, libp2p, Filecoin and other related projects we are laying the foundation for a more resilient, more secure, distributed version of the web. This requires rigorous engineering from protocol design through all the phases of implementation. We strike a balance between pragmatism (put it on a ship \u26f4), deeply informed protocol design, and strict application of strong engineering principles. All of this happens in an environment defined by curiosity, passion, and a love for open source.\u00a0\nGDPR for Job Applicants and Candidates\nWhen you apply to a job on this site, the personal data contained in your application will be collected by Protocol Labs, Inc.
