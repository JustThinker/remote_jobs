description:HockeyStack
We launched the final iteration of the product last year. We are now scaling our product and building out new features.
Technical Expectations
m
igrate our current frontend (Pug + JS + CSS) to React.
But we also expect you to:
Have an eye for sleek and pixel-perfect design (ex. Linear, Notion, Stripe)
Have enough Figma skills to design what you think
Think about the UX of our platform
...and actually execute these ideas in code
We want to make B2B analytics as accessible as possible but also have a cool product to show off ;) You will work directly with the founders to make HockeyStack the coolest product on the market.
Non-technical Expectations
Excellent communication skills (English) is a must.
We aren’t looking for someone with 20 years of experience, we are looking for smart people who are up for a challenge.
You should have experience with at least a CRM, an analytics tool, or a MarTech tool of some kind.
you should have some context on this industry beforehand
This also means that your role within the company is bound to grow and gain importance over time.
Why HockeyStack?
The company is very young for where we want to be, but although this may scare some people off, we believe that this is a tremendous opportunity to actually build something greater than all of us. We have the fastest team in our market right now and we want to keep it that way. We are already becoming a market leader in the attribution space, but we need more teammates (aka you) for our more ambitious goals.

What we do
DebugBear helps companies monitor and optimize the loading speed of their websites. We run continuous performance tests, generate detailed technical reports, and send out alerts when there's a problem.
Our users are a mix of developers, technical SEOs, and business owners.
The role
You will:
Be responsible for most of the development work on our product.
Consider user experience, implementation costs, and maintainability
Take on a variety of technical tasks and complete them successfully, sometimes in the absence of established processes
Be mindful of customer needs to understand and challenge requirements and solutions
The current team consists of the technical founder and one part-time developer. In this role you'll have a significant impact on the codebase and product.
Working at DebugBear
We value building a stable product that doesn't break unexpectedly, especially not outside work hours. That means working with proven technologies where possible, writing automated tests, and setting up monitoring to detect problems early.
While there is some flexibility with work hours, this is not an asynchronous role. Frequent communication is expected.
Collaboration is mostly through Slack and GitHub issues. We usually have 3 to 4 calls a week, though that's pretty flexible.

Node, TypeScript, Express
Postgres, ClickHouse

description:COMPANY
At 0x Labs, our mission is to create a tokenized world where all value can flow freely. We’re a mission-driven and diverse team composed of world class talent from Coinbase, Google, Meta, Bitso, Citi, Spotify and other top companies. We are a remote-first and fully distributed company, with team members located across all of the continents besides Antarctica. As early pioneers in the space, we’ve made significant technical contributions to various Ethereum standards over the years; fun fact - our team helped establish the NFT token standard (ERC721).
In joining us, you'll take part in transforming the way that value is exchanged on a global scale. We're passionate about open-source software and decentralized technology's potential to act as an equalizing force in the world, and our technology is deployed by a wide array of projects at the forefront of internet and economic advancement.
Founded in 2017, 0x Labs created and now partakes in the development of 0x protocol: the open-source, global backbone for decentralized exchange. Alongside the core protocol, we also build and maintain products and service offerings including Matcha, the search engine for tokens, and 0x API, the endpoint for multi-chain aggregated liquidity. All of these offerings allow 0x Labs to continue marching towards our vision of building a tokenized world where all value can flow freely at the best prices and with the lowest transaction costs. This way, we can help businesses eliminate the complexity of accessing decentralized markets across all layers of the Web3 exchange stack and have more time to focus on what matters most: their product.
0x currently supports 8 major blockchains: Ethereum, Polygon, Fantom, Avalanche, Arbitrum, Optimism, BNB Chain, and Celo, and the 0x ecosystem has been rapidly expanding. With integrations across all of the top wallets and apps, including MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet and Coinbase NFT, Polygon Wallet, Brave, Matcha, dYdX, Zapper, Zerion, and Shapeshift, 0x is fast becoming the trusted standard for all decentralized exchange.
We’re a remote-first company with core contributors in nearly ten countries and over twice as many cities. Our headquarters is in San Francisco, with an office available for anyone on the team to use at any time. We’ll consider your application regardless of where you call home.
MATCHA
Matcha is 0x Labs’ first consumer-facing product. Built on top of 0x API, Matcha is a meticulously designed decentralized exchange that makes it safe and easy for anyone in the world to access crypto assets on the Ethereum blockchain.

Responsibilities for this Lead developer role for "Drop-ET":
You will use our blueprint to build, measure, learn and pivot your way to a profitable and thriving company. This does not mean everything is set in stone because our founders will need to put their own stamp on everything they're doing. Later, you'll assemble a dedicated team and define a unique company culture.
Some technical founder activities include:
Design and build the technical blueprint of the company;
Building the (cloud) infrastructure;

Problem Statement:
Drop-ET is a Smart Logistics Platform for the APAC countries. Due to enormous growth in e-commerce A-Brands have been hijacking all delivery capacity in India. Delivery companies are overbooked, and the rest of the non-A brand e-commerce companies don’t have access to reliable delivery.
With Drop-ET we help delivery companies and medium-sized e-commerce companies get in control again. We are developing a fully equipped delivery EV, attainable for everyone. No CAPEX, everyone can immediately start as a delivery agent and they only pay-per-use. This delivery EV is connected to our platform, this means better routes, extra orders and collecting POI data during your Drop-ET rides. This amazing adventure still has some essential seats left. Do you want to hop on board of our EV and join our journey to a smarter Indian transport
ecosystem?
You have 5+ experience as a full-stack developer (i.e. front-end and back-end);
Strong experience with modern JavaScript (ES2017), Node.js, HTML,
CSS/SCSS, REACT as a framework and composition.
Experience with Restful API design, containerization (mostly docker), microservices, event-driven architecture, cloud architecture and understanding of data structures and algorithms.
Working in a fast-paced Continuous Integration & Deployment environment gets you excited.
Enforce code quality through Test-Driven Development and linting.
You know how Git works.
You’re proud of your work and welcome all feedback.
You are experienced in developing, testing, shipping and maintaining products under pressure;
You’re self-learning, independent, and have excellent problem-solving skills.
Working with Scrum/Agile working is second nature to you.

description:About Protocol Labs
Protocol Labs drives breakthroughs in computing to push humanity forward. Protocol Labs is a product-development lab, but behind the protocols and tools we build, behind the research and implementations, are passionate people, teammates and community members. Most teams in the Protocol Labs Network are fully distributed and work remotely around the world.

LI-Remote
Engineering at Protocol Labs
With IPFS, libp2p, Filecoin and other related projects we are laying the foundation for a more resilient, more secure, distributed version of the web. This requires rigorous engineering from protocol design through all the phases of implementation.
